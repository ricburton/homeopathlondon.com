          <p>Who uses homeopathy?
The Queen, Paul McCartney, Mahatma Ghandi and Yehudi Menuhin do, to name a few! Recommendations range from the inspired “There have been two great revelations in my life. The first was bebop, the second was homeopathy” Dizzy Gillespie to the more pragmatic “I also turn to homeopathic remedies for the treatment of digestion, travel sickness, insomnia and hay fever just to name a few. Homeopathy offers a safe, natural alternative that causes no side effects or drug interactions” Cindy Crawford.

When would I use homeopathy?
You may be suffering from an acute ailment such as flu or food poisoning or you may be sustaining a more chronic condition such as fibromyalgia or sinusitis. You may be expecting a child or have just given birth. Or you may just feel that you are exhausted all the time and don’t know why.  Homeopathy offers help in these and many other situations.
How would I know if it’s an option for me?
